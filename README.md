This repo contains files related to a draft translation of Woltereck's classic 1909 paper into English. 

This translation is in progress. I will update it periodically as I find time to work on it.

I'm working on this translation because this seems to be one of those papers that people cite without reading. It is difficult enough to find the original German version, and even that isn't helpful for the large number of people who don't read German.

(It is also probably one of the most important foundational papers in genetics and heredity.)

## Caveats

1. I am not a native or even a fluent German speaker. I hope to learn while carrying out this translation, but it's likely that I will make language mistakes in the process.

2. I am an employee of Phase Genomics. This project is unrelated to my work for PG.
